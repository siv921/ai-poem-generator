      <p>
        No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the
        continent, A part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea,
        Europe is the less. As well as if a promontory were. As well as if a
        manor of thy friend’s Or of thine own were: Any man’s death diminishes
        me, Because I am involved in mankind, And therefore never send to know
        for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.
